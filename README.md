## Overview
   * A basic linear regression model that finds line of best fit
   * Utilizes the gradient descent algorithm
   * Currently Random data sets and no input for prediction value. Intention is to continue development and integrate the model with some api fetches

## Concepts Learned
   ### Python:
      * Dataclasses
      * Basic numpy methods and types
      * matplotlib scatter plots
   ### ML Fundamentals:
      * Univariate linear regression
      * J(w, b) or the error of a set of w and b values
      * Gradient Descent algorithm to determine the "best" w and b values for a given dataset
      * Using gradient descent when there are no relative maximums, only absolute
